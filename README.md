=============
My first Flask app! I deployed it on Heroku. 

It generates random song lyrics based on a large lyrics corpus.

Prerequisites
--------------

* Flask
* A MongoDB database with the correct format and song lyrics 
* NLTK version 2.0.5 is required for the language model to generate random song lyrics. Ngram functionality was removed from NLTK in versions 3+ (due to bugs).


Purpose
--------
- Understand how to deploy a real app on Heroku
- Learn some Jinja2 templating
- Have some fun with NLTK's random word generation capabilities
